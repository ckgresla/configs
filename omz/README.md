# oh my zsh configurations
BASH is meh, FISH smells, might as well ZSH around



on using themes:
* the themes included in the `themes` dir should be minimal enough to work with a basic `omz` setup (no plugins?)
  * to use, copy a theme into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` dir
  * then reference it in our `~/.zshrc` by name, i.e; `ZSH_THEME=wiz` for the themefile `wiz.zsh-theme`
  * still questioning everything? I wish you nothing but the very best of luck, please consult the docs- https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
